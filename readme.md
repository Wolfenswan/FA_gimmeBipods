FA_gimmeBipods
==

**Description**<br/>
Server-side addon to give bipods to players in older missions, if they use a gear assignment script which removes bipods. Bipods are given to player if their in-game class is either AR/MG/Sniper/Marksman or one of the corresponding F3 assignGear types.

**Usage**<br/>
Download .zip and run the pbo as addon on your server. Requires CBA.

**Version history**<br/>
v1 - 02/04/2015 - initial release<br/>

**Known issues**<br/>
This script only runs once at mission start, thus might not work properly with JIP or Respawn.
